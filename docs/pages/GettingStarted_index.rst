Accessing BioModME
============================

BioModME was built using the Rshiny framework with the injection of customized
HTML/CSS and javascript. As such, it is availble as a fully deployed web 
application hosted by CTSI of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Additionally, 
source code is provided for the application to be run locally.  

.. note::
    Online Server is a good option that requires no download of application or 
    knowledge of running R. 

    We intend to package the application with Electron to have a fully 
    deployable version.
