Steps: 

#. Scroll down to the **Equations** box in the **Create Model** tab. 
#. Change the **Active Compartment** to "Liver_Tissue".
#. Change the **Reaction Direction** to "Forward" since this is a one way reaction.
#. This reaction has one product and one reactant. Make sure **Reactant 1** is 
   **A_3** and **Product 1** is **B_3**. Change the **Forward Rate Constant** 
   to **k_1**.
#. Press the **Add Equation** button.
