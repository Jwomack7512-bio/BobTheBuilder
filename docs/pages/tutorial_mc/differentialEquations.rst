Differential Equations 
=========================

Navigate to the final box **“Differential Equations”**. 

This tab is used to generate and see the mathematical equations that govern 
our model.  This tab will begin with all species being equal to “NA” until the 
generate button is pressed or model is executed.  

Press the “Generate” button to solve the system for its differential equation 
output and display them in text form.

**Note:** The right sidebar of the "System of Differential Equations" box has an 
option to "pretty" the equations using a built-in algorithm (this does not 
change the mathematical functions, just gives a cleaner look to the equations).
The equations are currently listed in the form that provides order to the 
flux showing equation differential equations followed by input/output 
derived equations.
