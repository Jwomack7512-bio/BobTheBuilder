============================
Define Variables
============================

The application loads on the “Create Model” tab.  
Here, we will build our model, setting up variables, equations, and parameters.
Each of these components are their own box on the page. 
On load, the application will create a starting compartment named “comp_1”, 
which can be seen in the “Compartments” box. 
Click on the “Name” cell of the table to change the compartments name (cell).
We will also change the volume name here (V_cell). 
In a single compartment model, the physical volume is not of much importance 
so we will leave that as a value of 0.
